# TASK 2 â€“ Tic-Tac-Toe with Unbeatable AI

This project is a **Python-based Tic-Tac-Toe game** where players compete against an **unbeatable AI**.  
The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning** to ensure optimal decision-making.  
Built with **Gradio**, the interface offers an interactive web-based experience, making this a perfect educational project for learning **game AI, search algorithms, and Python GUI development**.
